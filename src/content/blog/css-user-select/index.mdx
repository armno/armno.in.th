I'm working on a mobile web project. Today I found a strange bug that
input fields were not working. When tap/click on an input field, it receives `:focus` state
but I cannot type anything - no text shows up.
It happens only in Safari and Mobile Safari on iOS.

I've never found this bug before. So I did a search with keywords `Safari cannot type in input`.
I found a StackOverflow thread (of course ..)
[_Input field iOS Safari bug — Can't type in any text_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32851413/input-field-ios-safari-bug-cant-type-in-any-text)

The accepted answer suggests putting `-webkit-user-select: text` to the input field.
So I did just that. And it worked. I can type in the input field and the text shows up.

The mobile web project I'm working on needs to provide a native-app-like experience.
I have this rule applies globally since the beginning of the project:

```css
* {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
  -webkit-touch-callout: none;
  user-select: none;
}
```

[`user-select: none`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select) prevents iOS's text selection UI to show up when users long-press on text content.
For example, when long-press on a button, this could happen.

<Picture
  src="/images/css-user-select/select-text-menu.png"
  alt="callout menu on mobile Safari"
  caption="Unwanted callout menu when long press on a UI element"
/>

`user-select: none` was added to prevent this issue.

Since I have the rule with `*` selector, it applies to everything,
including the input fields.

And it causes a side effect &mdash; on Safari, users are not able to type in the input fields
when there is `user-select: none` applied to them.
That's why the default behavior of input fields is broken.

<WarningMessage>
<strong>I should have done it differently.</strong> Instead of setting <code>user-select: none</code> to everything,
set it to only elements that need this behavior.<br/>Setting <code>user-select: none</code>
can raise some usability and accessibility concerns.

</WarningMessage>

Today I learned 2 things:

1. Never put `user-select: none` to input elements
2. Try not to break the browser's defaults
