Today I learned how to do a fuzzy search in command history using [`fzf`](https://armno.in.th/2019/08/21/fzf/),
and a bit about `sed`.

It is useful when I want to search for a specific command I ran before,
but I don't really remember what it was.
For example,

```sh
$ docker-compose exec php artisan migrate --seed
```

With help of fzf, I can easily search through commands list in `history` and find what I want using the fuzzy search.

## macOS `sed` and GNU `sed`

In the [Examples page](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/examples#command-history) of fzf repo,
there are examples of `fh()` functions
that uses fzf to search in command history.

```sh
# https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/examples#command-history
# fh - repeat history
fh() {
  print -z $( ([ -n "$ZSH_NAME" ] && fc -l 1 || history) | fzf +s --tac | sed -r 's/ *[0-9]*\*? *//' | sed -r 's/\\/\\\\/g')
}
```

When I run `fh` function in the terminal, fzf works fine. I can do the search.
But when I select a command I want, I got an error from `sed`.

```sh
sed: illegal option -- r
usage: sed script [-Ealn] [-i extension] [file ...]
       sed [-Ealn] [-i extension] [-e script] ... [-f script_file] ... [file ...]
sed: illegal option -- r
usage: sed script [-Ealn] [-i extension] [file ...]
       sed [-Ealn] [-i extension] [-e script] ... [-f script_file] ... [file ...]
```

I did some Google search, and found that `sed` on macOS [is not the same](https://riptutorial.com/sed/topic/9436/bsd-macos-sed-vs--gnu-sed-vs--the-posix-sed-specification) with `sed` on Linux.
That's why I don't have `-r` option in my `sed` as I'm using macOS Catalina.

To fix that, There are 2 options

- Change `-r` option of sed to `-E`, which does the same thing - to intepret a regular expression.
So the function above would be:

```sh
fh() {
  print -z $( ([ -n "$ZSH_NAME" ] && fc -l 1 || history) | fzf +s --tac | sed -E 's/ *[0-9]*\*? *//' | sed -E 's/\\/\\\\/g')
}
```

- Or, install `gnu-sed` which has `-r` option, and replace `sed` with `gsed` instead.

```sh
$ brew install gnu-sed
```

```sh
fh() {
  print -z $( ([ -n "$ZSH_NAME" ] && fc -l 1 || history) | fzf +s --tac | gsed -r 's/ *[0-9]*\*? *//' | gsed -r 's/\\/\\\\/g')
}
```

I go with the first option.

Finally, I add `--height 50%` option to `fzf` so it takes only half of the screen.
I also rename the function to just `h()` to make it easier to remember.
("`h` for history")

```sh
h() {
  print -z $( ([ -n "$ZSH_NAME" ] && fc -l 1 || history) | fzf +s --tac --height "50%" | sed -E 's/ *[0-9]*\*? *//' | sed -E 's/\\/\\\\/g')
}
```
