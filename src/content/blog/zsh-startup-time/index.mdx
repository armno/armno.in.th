Inspired by articles by Chai Phonbopit on
[ทำไม ZSH ของเราช้าจัง? + ทำให้เร็วขึ้นได้มั้ย](https://devahoy.com/blog/2020/08/increase-speed-of-zsh/)
and by Matthew J. Clemente on [Speeding Up My Shell (Oh My Zsh)](https://blog.mattclemente.com/2020/06/26/oh-my-zsh-slow-to-load.html),
I can make my zsh terminal loads faster by lazy-loading [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

(Normally I'm not bothered by my zsh's startup time because
I don't open new terminal windows/tabs a whole lot in a day.
But if I can make things a bit faster, then why not get some [marginal gains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQxYlu12ji8)?.)

## 1. Measure the current startup time

zsh's startup can be measured by running a script:

```bash
$ for i in $(seq 1 10); do /usr/bin/time zsh -i -c exit; done

# or using $SHELL - should work with bash
$ for i in $(seq 1 10); do /usr/bin/time $SHELL -i -c exit; done
```

([source](https://htr3n.github.io/2018/07/faster-zsh/#performance-analysis))

- `seq` prints sequences of numbers. We use it with `for .. in` loop to run the commands 10 times
- `time` is a utility command to execute a command and then print out time used
- `-i` running `zsh` in interactive mode - meaning we can run (or pass) commands to it to execute
- `-c` tells `zsh` to take the next part which is `exit` as a command to execute, not as a parameter

My zsh startup time before optimize was ~1.1-1.2 seconds.

## 2. Analyze my `.zshrc` file

I'm using zsh with oh-my-zsh. Whatever goes into `.zshrc` file can add more startup time to zsh.

I don't have much in my `.zshrc` file. It looks like this:

```bash
# (1)
. /Users/armno/code/z/z.sh

# (2)
BASE16_SHELL="$HOME/.config/base16-shell/"
[ -n "$PS1" ] && \
    [ -s "$BASE16_SHELL/profile_helper.sh" ] && \
        eval "$("$BASE16_SHELL/profile_helper.sh")"

# (3)
export ZSH="/Users/armno/.oh-my-zsh"
ZSH_THEME="cloud-armno"
DISABLE_UPDATE_PROMPT="true"
plugins=(zsh-completions zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

source ~/.aliases
source ~/.functions

export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

# (4)
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

1. Loads [`z`](https://github.com/rupa/z)
2. Loads [`base16_shell`](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell)
3. Initialize oh-my-zsh and its plugins
4. Loads `nvm`

The biggest bottleneck seems to be nvm's scripts, [as mentioned by many people](https://www.google.com/search?q=nvm+slow+zsh).

## 3. Disable nvm's scripts entirely

I comment out the last 2 lines from my `.zshrc`

```bash
# export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
# [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

open a new termnial tab, and re-run the profiling script.
With this alone, zsh's startup time goes down **from ~1.2s to ~0.17s**.

This is now a lot faster, but it also means I will not be able to use nvm.

I still need nvm, sometimes.

> If you're not using nvm, I would suggest comment out some scripts/plugins from your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file,
re-run profiling script, and repeat. It should help to see which scripts are slowing down the startup time.

## 4. Lazy-load nvm

Lazy-loading nvm makes nvm available only when it is needed: when running `nvm`, `node`, `npm`
or gloablly installed command for the first time, and not right away then the shell starts.

It can be done by using [`zsh-nvm`](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm) plugin.

First, I install the plugin.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm $ZSH/custom/plugins/zsh-nvm
```

Then in `.zshrc` file, set `NVM_LAZY_LOAD` environment variable to `true`
and add `zsh-nvm` to `plugins=()` list.

```bash
export NVM_LAZY_LOAD=true

plugins=(... zsh-nvm)
```

(note: setting `NVM_LAZY_LOAD` variable must be placed <em>before</em> the `plugins=` line in `.zshrc` file.)

Then I `source` the `.zshrc` file so my changes take effect.

## 5. Measure again

Running the same script from 1. again, zsh's startup time is now at ~0.2 seconds.

### Summary

- I use [the one-liner script](#1-measure-the-current-startup-time) to measure zsh's startup time
- Instead of using nvm's [official install script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script), I use **zsh-nvm** plugin to load nvm
- I set `NVM_LAZY_LOAD` environment in my `.zshrc` file to `true`
- My zsh's startup time reduces **from ~1.2 seconds to ~0.2 seconds**.
