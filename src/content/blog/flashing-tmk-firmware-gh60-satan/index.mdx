<p class="lead">
  I have a custom mechanical keyboard built with GH60 Satan PCB.
  It is currently used by my colleague and she needs some custom keys.
</p>

The GH60 PCB uses TMK firmware. I kind of forgot already how to flash the firmware
onto a board with TMK
so I take this note also for my future self.

Here are steps I use to customize the keyboard's firmware with custom keys.

![the keyboard itself](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/keeb.jpg)

The keyboard is a 60% with standard ANSI layout.
The goals are:

- turn 4 keys at the bottom right into arrow keys

![GH60 with arrow keys](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/gh60l0.png)

- add `print screen` key somewhere on the keyboard.

-----

I go to [keyboard-layout-editor.com](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)
then I go to the menu on the top > select **Preset** > **Default 60%**.
It will load the layout in the editor area.

![default 60% layout](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/default-60.png)

First, I want to remap the `right shift` key to an arrow `up`.

I go to [https://tkg.io/#help](https://tkg.io/#help) and search for `up`.
The values in the right column are ones I need.

![search for up key on tkg.io](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/search.png)

Back to the keyboard-layout-editor.com, I select the right shift key (it will highlight in red border).
Then I change the `Top Legend:` value from `Shift` to `UP`.

And I do the same for `LEFT`, `DOWN`, and `RIGHT` keys.

<WarningMessage>
  Values are case-insensitive. <code>up</code> and <code>Up</code> and <code>UP</code> are the same key.
</WarningMessage>

## Layers

I want to have another layer of the keyboard to have more keys.
For now it will have only 2 keys on the second layer: `esc` and `print screen`.

I map the `caps lock` and the right `alt` keys to `FN0` - the Function key.
I will use them to toggle another layer of the keyboard.

<WarningMessage>
  The function key itself doesn't do anything special, but we will set its behavior later on.
</WarningMessage>

For another layer, there are only 2 keys in this layer: `esc` and `print screen`.
The layout look like this:

![layer2](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/l1.png)

I go to `Raw data` tab below the keyboard layout.
I will need raw data for each layer to build the firmware.

![raw data](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/raw-data.png)

Here are my raw data for both layers.

### Layer0

```
["~\n`","!\n1","@\n2","#\n3","$\n4","%\n5","^\n6","&\n7","*\n8","(\n9",")\n0","_\n-","+\n=",{w:2},"Backspace"],
[{w:1.5},"Tab","Q","W","E","R","T","Y","U","I","O","P","{\n[","}\n]",{w:1.5},"|\n\\"],
[{c:"#f2bc52",w:1.75},"FN0",{c:"#cccccc"},"A","S","D","F","G","H","J","K","L",":\n;","\"\n'",{w:2.25},"Enter"],
[{w:2.25},"Shift","Z","X","C","V","B","N","M","<\n,",">\n.","?\n/",{c:"#942222",t:"#ffffff",w:2.75},"UP"],
[{c:"#cccccc",t:"#000000",w:1.25},"Ctrl",{w:1.25},"Win",{w:1.25},"Alt",{a:7,w:6.25},"",{c:"#f2bc52",a:4,w:1.25},"FN0",{c:"#942222",t:"#ffffff",sm:"cherry",w:1.25},"LEFT",{w:1.25},"DOWN",{w:1.25},"RIGHT"]
```

### Layer1

```
[{c:"#f2bc52"},"ESC",{c:"#cccccc",a:7},"","","","","","","","","","","","",{w:2},""],
[{w:1.5},"","","","","","","","","","",{c:"#f2bc52"},"PSC",{c:"#cccccc"},"","",{w:1.5},""],
[{w:1.75},"","","","","","","","","","","","",{w:2.25},""],
[{w:2.25},"","","","","","","","","","","",{w:2.75},""],
[{w:1.25},"",{w:1.25},"",{w:1.25},"",{w:6.25},"",{w:1.25},"",{w:1.25},"",{w:1.25},"",{w:1.25},""]
```

Then I go back to [tkg.io](https://tkg.io/#), on the home page, paste the copied raw data into `Layer0`
and `Layer1` fields.

![layer1](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/layer1.png)

## `FN0` key

Now we are going to set the behavior for the function key `FN0`.

Still on tkg.io, under `Fn` section, at `Fn0` I select **Layout action > Momentary** and select `layer 1`
on the right side.

![fn key behavior](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/fn-option.png)

This means when I press and hold `FN0` key, it will switch to layer1.
When I release the `FN0` key, it will switch back to the default `layer0`.

Then I download the `.eep` file.

## Flashing `.eep` file to the keyboard

First I clone the `tkg-toolkit` repo to my computer.

![tkg-toolkit repo](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/tkg.png)

Then I copy the downloaded `.eep` file from the previous step to under `mac/` in this folder
as I'm using a Mac to flash the firmware.

```sh
$ cp ~/Desktop/keymap.eep ~/code/tkg-toolkit/mac
```

I go to `~/code/tkg-toolkit/mac` folder and run

```sh
$ ./reflash.sh keymap.eep
```

enter `Y`

and when it says **"waiting for bootloder"**, I flip the keyboard and press `RESET` button on the PCB.

![reset button](/images/flashing-tmk-firmware-gh60-satan/reset-button.jpg)


wait for a few seconds and it is done. the new firmware is now on the keyboard.
