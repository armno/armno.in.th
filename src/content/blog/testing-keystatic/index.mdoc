will Keystatic work for me?

so, okay.

- ~~the post must be a~~        ~~`slug.mdoc`~~        ~~file, not~~        ~~`slug/index.mdoc`~~        ~~file.~~ not true. it can be in its own folder with proper config below.
- `image` in keystatic config must be updated with to keep the images in the same folder with the post mdoc file.

```js
images: {
  directory: 'src/content/blog',
  publicPath: '../../../content/blog/',
},
```
