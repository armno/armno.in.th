I'm working on a website that has a few short animations in `<video>` elements on the page.

I wanted a quick way to create a poster image from a video file (mp4) to use with `poster` attribute of the `<video>` element. The poster image will display while the video file is loading. This gives a hint to the user that there's some content there.

I will use the first frame of the video file as a poster image. When the video file finishes loading and starts playing, there will be a smooth transition from the poster image to the video.

Creating a poster image from an mp4 file can be done with [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) command line tool.

```bash
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -frames:v 1 video-poster.png
```

This will create a PNG image that has the same width and height of the video file.

- `-i` specifies path of the input file
- `-frames:v 1` stops working after the 1st frame (because we need only 1 frame). `:v` is a [Stream specifier](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Stream-specifiers-1) to tell ffmpeg that we are working with a video file.
- The last parameter is the output file name `video-poster.png`. If I want a JPG file, I can change `.png` to `.jpg` in the file name. ffmpeg will also handle image conversion.

To create a poster image at a specific time instead of at the beginning of the video, add `-ss` parameter with value in seconds

```bash
ffmpeg -ss 1.4 -i video.mp4 -frames:v 1 video-poster.png
```

Then I can use the poster image with `<video>` element like:

```bash
<video width="200" height="200" loop autoplay muted playsinline
  poster="video-poster.png">
  <source src="video.mpg" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```
<Picture src="/images/ffmpeg-video-poster-image/output.jpg" alt="The source video file compares with output poster image"
  caption="The source video file compares with output poster image" />
