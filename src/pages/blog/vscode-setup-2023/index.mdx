I'm a web developer and I use VSCode as my main code editor for many years.
Since VSCode is highly customizable,
I like to tweak it here and there from time to time.

Here is my current setup of VSCode.
This is what I will do if I have to setup it from scratch.

## Vim


I learned Vim some years ago. Still can't say I'm a Vim user but I get used to some of the Vim motions since then.
The first thing I will do is to _Vimify_ VSCode

by installing Vim extension.

then remap `jf` to `esc` to quickly switch from Insert mode to Command mode.
It's the same mapping I use in Vim.

That's basically it. I only use standard Vim motions and 1 custom command.


0. key repeat (OS settings)
```
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
````
2. Basic settings (Theme, Icon, Font, zoom level +1, tree indent)
3. Extensions
4. UI
  - hide status bar
  - hide minimap
  - hide breadcrumbs
  - hide icons in panel
  - hide right sidebar
  - move search to bottom
5. disable Peek
6. shortcuts and custom shortcuts
  - shortcuts to open explorer, search, terminal
  - split pane and moving around
  - setting custom key binding from command palette

TODO: open file from sidebar with shortcut
TODO: share clipboard between cmd+c and p in vim
