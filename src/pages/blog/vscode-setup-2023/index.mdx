I'm a web developer and I use VSCode as my main code editor for many years.
Since VSCode is highly customizable,
I like to tweak it here and there from time to time.

Here is my current setup of VSCode.
This is what I will do if I have to setup it from scratch today.

## Vim

Still can't say I'm a Vim user, but at least I'm comfortable with basic Vim motions.
The first thing I will do after installing VSCode is to _Vimify_ it.

by installing Vim extension.

then remap `esc` to `jk` to quickly switch from Insert mode to Command mode.
It's the same mapping I use in Vim.

In VSCode, I have to disable Press and Hold feature of the keyboard at system level.
This allows me to long press `j` to turn into `jjjjjj` and not just `j`.

```
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
````

## Basic settings & UI

- Theme and icon theme: Monokai Pro
- Font: JetBrains Mono with ligatures enabled.
- Zoom level: +1. Instead of making the font size bigger, I like to zoom the whole window to +1 and make the font size smaller at 11px. It renders the same visual size of font size 14 at zoom level 0, but other UI elements are bigger.
- Increase tree indent to 20px

I was a big fan of Sublime Text's minial UI back then.
I try to make VSCode looks minimal by:

- Hide status bar
- Hide minimap
- Hide breadcrumbs
- Hide icons in panel
- Hide right sidebar

Last but no least, I move the global search panel from the left to the bottom sidebar.
It is easier to read for longer text in the search results.

- move search to bottom

3. Extensions
5. disable Peek
6. shortcuts and custom shortcuts
  - shortcuts to open explorer, search, terminal
  - split pane and moving around
  - setting custom key binding from command palette
