I'm a web developer and I use VSCode as my main code editor for many years.
Since VSCode is highly customizable,
I like to tweak it here and there from time to time.

Here is my current setup of VSCode.
This is what I will do if I have to setup it from scratch.

## Vim

I learned Vim some years ago. Still can't say I'm a Vim user but I get used to some of the Vim motions since then.
The first thing I will do is to _Vimify_ VSCode

by installing Vim extension.

then remap `jf` to `esc` to quickly switch from Insert mode to Command mode.
It's the same mapping I use in Vim.

I have to disable Press and Hold feature of the keyboard at system level.

```
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
````

That's basically it for my Vim setup in VSCode.

## Basic settings & UI

- Theme and icon theme: Monokai Pro
- Font: JetBrains Mono
- Zoom level: +1. Instead of making the font size bigger, I like to zoom the whole window to +1 and make the font size smaller at 11px. It renders the same visual size of font size 14 at zoom level 0, but other UI elements are bigger.
- Increase tree indent to 20px
- Hide status bar
- Hide minimap
- Hide breadcrumbs
- Hide icons in panel
- Hide right sidebar
- move search to bottom

3. Extensions
5. disable Peek
6. shortcuts and custom shortcuts
  - shortcuts to open explorer, search, terminal
  - split pane and moving around
  - setting custom key binding from command palette
