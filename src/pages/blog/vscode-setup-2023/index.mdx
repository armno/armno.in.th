I'm a web developer and I use VSCode as my main code editor for many years.
Since VSCode is highly customizable,
I like to tweak it here and there from time to time.

Here is my current setup of VSCode.
This is what I will do if I have to setup it from scratch today.

## Vim

Still can't say I'm a Vim user, but at least I'm comfortable with basic Vim motions.
The first thing I will do after installing VSCode is to _Vimify_ it.

by installing Vim extension in VSCode - it's my most important VSCode extension.

then remap `esc` to `jk` to quickly switch from Insert mode to Command mode.
It's the same mapping I use in Vim.

In VSCode, I have to disable Press and Hold feature of the keyboard at system level.
This allows me to long press `j` to turn into `jjjjjj` and not just `j`.

```bash
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

## Basic settings & UI

- Theme and icon theme: Monokai Pro
- Font: JetBrains Mono with ligatures enabled.

I was a big fan of Sublime Text's minimal UI back then.
I try to make VSCode looks minimal by:

- Hiding status bar
- Hiding minimap
- Hiding breadcrumbs
- Hiding icons in panel
- Hiding right sidebar

Search: I use the default global search (e.g. search in the entire project) a lot. The default shortcut is `cmd` + `shift` + `f`,
which opens the search panel in the left sidebar. There are a few issues there.

- The space is limited so I can't see much of the long text.
- There is no syntax highlighting there
- The panel uses sans-serif font instead of the monospace font.

I instead remap the shortcut to Search Editor command. This opens the search window in a new tab.
It's easier to skim through the results.

- Zoom level: +1. Instead of making the font size bigger, I like to zoom the whole window to +1 and make the font size smaller at 11px. It renders the same visual size of font size 14 at zoom level 0, but other UI elements are bigger.
- Increase tree indent to 20px

## Extensions

I don't have a lot of extensions and I tend to adjust activated extensions per project
and try to use as little extension as possible.

5. disable Peek
6. shortcuts and custom shortcuts
  - shortcuts to open explorer, search, terminal
  - split pane and moving around
  - setting custom key binding from command palette

TODO: open file from sidebar with shortcut

TODO: share clipboard between cmd+c and p in vim
