I'm a web developer and I use VSCode as my main code editor for many years.
Since VSCode is highly customizable,
I like to tweak it here and there from time to time.

Here is my current setup of VSCode. It aims for speed and minimal UI.
This is what I will do if I have to setup it from scratch today.

## Vim

I'm not a regular Vim user, but I got used to move around using Vim motions
(and I know how to [exit Vim](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim)).

The first thing I will do after installing VSCode is to _Vimify_ it by installing Vim extension in VSCode.
I only need to use basic Vim motions

Then I remap `esc` to `jk` to quickly switch from Insert mode to Command mode.
It's the same mapping I use in Vim.

```json
"vim.insertModeKeyBindings": [
  {
    "before": ["j", "f"],
    "after": ["<Esc>"]
  }
]
```

I also have to disable Press and Hold feature of the keyboard at system level.
This allows me to long press `j` to turn into `jjjjjj` and not just `j` in VSCode.

```bash
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

## Basic settings & UI

- Theme and icon theme: [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/vscode) for dark them, GitHub light for light theme.
- Font: [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) with ligatures.

When I used Sublime Text, I was a big fan of its minial UI.
I try to make VSCode looks minimal by hiding things I don't need to see,
or things that can be accessed with keyboard shortcuts.

- Status bar
- Minimap
- Breadcrumbs
- Activity bar a.k.a icons in sidebar panel
- Right/Secondary sidebar
- Layout control icons

```json
{
  "workbench.statusBar.visible": false,
  "breadcrumbs.enabled": false,
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
  "workbench.activityBar.visible": false,
  "workbench.layoutControl.enabled": false,
}
```
My typical VSCode window looks like this

- Zoom level: +1. Instead of increasing the font size, I like to zoom the whole window to +1 and make the font size smaller at 11px. It renders the same visual size of font size 14 at zoom level 0, but it makes other UI elements bigger and easier to read.
- Increase tree indent in Explorer view from 8px to 16px
- Disable Peek Preview for multiple references or definitions.


## Search

The default search menu is initialy accessible from the primary sidebar.
There are a few issues there.

- The space is limited so I can't see much of the long text.
- There is no syntax highlighting in the search text and results
- The panel uses sans-serif font instead of the monospace font. It's harder to read the code in san-serif font than monospace.

The remap the keyboard shortcut to New Search Editor command instead. This opens the search window in a new tab.
It's easier to skim through the results.

However this Search Editor is still not perfect. It doesn't update the search result in real time when the changes are made. Also its syntax highlighting doesn't work for every language.

## Extensions

I don't have a lot of extensions installed. I tend to adjust activated extensions based on the project I'm working on
Since speed it crucial for me, I try to use as little extensions as possible.

6. shortcuts and custom shortcuts
  - shortcuts to open explorer, search, terminal
  - split pane and moving around
  - setting custom key binding from command palette
