Today I learned how to create a template for Git's commit message
from [thoughtbot's blog](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/better-commit-messages-with-a-gitmessage-template).

---

Running `$ git commit` opens an editor window with some default text in it.
Normally we would put our commit message at top of the file where the empty line is.

We can create a template for the space in the commit window
with the text we want.

First, we would need to create a text file with our custom messages.
I want to start the commit message with `#TICKET_ID` to refer to the
related ticket in my ticket system. Then follow with the commit summary.

Filename can be anything but I like to name it `.gitmessage`.

```sh
$ touch .gitmessage
```

```
'#[TICKET_ID] - [COMMIT SUMMARY]
(empty line)
```

- Note: I prefix the line with `'` to prevent Git to see it as a comment.
(A line started with `#` is excluded from the commit message.)
- I also add an empty line at the end to separate my template with Git's default template.

Then we update the Git's config `commit.template` to point to the file.

```sh
$ git config commit.template .gitmessage
```

Then when we run `$ git commit`, the editor window is now pre-filled with our template.

<Picture
  src="/images/git-commit-message-template/commit-with-template.png"
  alt="git commit with template"
  caption="commit message with pre-filled template"
/>

I prefer to have the same template for all repositories,
so move the template to my home folder and make it a global configuration.

```sh
$ mv .gitmessage ~/
$ git config --global commit.template "~/.gitmessage"
```

Note: the template file will not work with the shorthand command `$ git commit -am`.

## Using tools to build a better habit

We can see this feature of Git as a tool to help us to build a better habit
of writing good commit messages.

Instead of saying _"I will try to write better commit messages"_,
having this pre-filled template every time we going to make a commit
can help us to _try_ more. Because some of it is already there
and we will see it always. It enforces us just a little more.

Of course, we can delete the whole pre-fill text and go back
to the bad habit like putting _"fix bugs"_ or _"update code"_ as a commit message.
But it is less likely to happen. We typically don't want to destroy our own good will
to build a better habit.

Be sure to check [Matija MarohniÄ‡](https://silvenon.com)'s post:

and some of the even better templates for the commit message from
