# Tools I use

Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) where developers share their hardware/software/tools they use regularly. Here are my tools, updated for 2023.

## Software

### Programming

* Terminal: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/version3.html) with

  * [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with my slightly modified version of the [cloud](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles/blob/master/cloud-armno.zsh-theme) theme

  * [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) and [base16-iterm2](https://github.com/martinlindhe/base16-iterm2)

  * [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) - the replacement for `cd` command.

  * [dotfiles ](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles)

* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) for a quick editing from the terminal. Here is my [`.vimrc`](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).

* Git: I use command line Git with [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) to render better diffs and logs

* [JetBrains Mono fonts](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) in both code editors and terminal.

* Terminal colors: I have both dark and light themes set up and use depending on the light conditions. I create `dark` and `light` aliases to switch between base16 themes.

  * dark: `base16_material-darker`

  * light: `base16_google-light`

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and themes

  * dark: [`Monokai Pro`](https://monokai.pro/)

  * light: [`GitHub Light Default`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)

### Others

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager

* [Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary) as the development browser

* [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) for shortcuts, windows management

* [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) for shortcuts, keyboard remappings

* [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) for image editing

* [Skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch) for quick image editing

* Google Photos to backup all of my photos
