# Tools I use

Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) where developers share their
hardware/software/tools they use regularly, here are my tools, updated for 2021-2022.

## Software

### Programming

- Terminal: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/version3.html) with
  - [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with my slightly modified version of [cloud](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles/blob/master/cloud-armno.zsh-theme) theme
  - [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell)
  - [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
  - [dotfiles ](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) for a quick editing from the terminal. Here is my [`.vimrc`](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).
- Git: I use command line Git with [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)
- [JetBrains Mono fonts](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) in both code editors and terminal.
- Terminal colors: I have both dark and light themes set up and use depending on the light conditions. I create `dark` and `light` shell commands to switch between base16 themes.
  - dark: `base16_material-darker`
  - light: `base16_google-light`

- VSCode Themes: also both dark and light themes
  - dark: [`New Moon`](https://taniarascia.github.io/new-moon/)
  - light: [`GitHub Light Default`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)
